# Updating Local/Master Repository

> The task of 'pushing' changes made in your local repository to the master repository can be executed as so:

![repoPic](https://github.com/SecurePortals/SecPort-Setup/blob/master/Documentation/UpdateLocalRepo.png)

> But it's important to note that you need to be inside the directory that you're updating. In order to step into the directory for SecPort-Setup, we need to:

```bsh
cd SecPort-Setup
```

> From our HOME directory (Which is usually the root User folder for your login on your computer). 

## Updating Local Repository: 

```bsh
git pull
```

## Pushing updates to local repo to master repo:

```bsh
git pull
```
```bsh
git add -A
```
```bsh
git commit -m "<add a message that describes the changes>"
```
```bsh
git push
```
