            <span id="hello">Hello!</span> It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, and I thank you whole-heartedly for taking the time to look through my portfolio. I am sincerely honored to have your time, and hope that this site can be a keyhole into, not only my industry education and experience, but also to who I am as a person. I would like to extend an invitation to you, to join me as I tell my story.

            I am currently an undergraduate student in the Geography Department at the University of Washington in Seattle. I currently work as a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) Software Developer for the City of Seattle. I first discovered software developing on a whim in my sophomore year at UWS, when one of my friends told me I should give it a try, to see if I like it. I loved it. Since, I haven't been able to turn away from the lure of engaging in software through designing the tapestry on which it exists. There are a few important qualities to my character:

        <p>
            2. I know how to work in a team. *Explanation*
        </p>
        <p>
            3. I know when I've done my best work. *Explanation*
